# üöÄ ETH CLI
### ‚ö°Ô∏è Query the blockchain right - from your terminal
###### ...and save opening another browser tab!

‚ú® Built for the Moralis hackathon

#### Why?
How many memory hogging, ad serving, cookie tracking tabs do you have open whilst trying to look up blockchain data? I thought so - ***too many***. Rest your browser, fearless Web3 developer, and return to a more pure, beautiful experience. Your terminal.
